= Evaluation

Project configuration for Hercules CI is written in the Nix language. Your agent will evaluate the `herculesCI` attribute of a flake, or, if a repository does not contain `flake.nix`, the agent will look for that attribute in `nix/ci.nix`, `ci.nix` or `default.nix`.

Inside this expression, Hercules CI looks for an optional but recommended `herculesCI` attribute. If this attribute is not present, the evaluator will either:

 * if it is **a flake**, evaluate a default `onPush` job with sensible defaults, or
 * if it is a `ci.nix` or `default.nix`, fall back to the xref:legacy-evaluation.adoc[pre-0.9 evaluation behavior].

A simple example of an `herculesCI` attribute looks as follows:

[source,nix]
----
  herculesCI = { ... }: {
    onPush.default = {
      outputs = { ... }: {
        # Attributes here will be built for each push.
        hello = pkgs.hello;
      };
    };
  };
----

== `herculesCI` Value

The `herculesCI` attribute can be a function producing an attribute set. If no parameters are needed, xref:attributes-herculesCI[the attribute set] can be provided directly instead.

[[params-herculesCI]]
== `herculesCI` Parameters

When you define the `herculesCI` attribute as a function, it will receive the following arguments, providing context for your CI/CD configuration <<attributes-herculesCI, attributes>>

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile/HerculesCIArgs.hs
[[params-herculesCI-commit]]
=== `ref`, `branch`, `tag`, `rev`, `shortRev`

These strings represent the version and origin of the source that contains the `herculesCI` attribute.

`branch` and `tag` may be null.

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile/HerculesCIArgs.hs
[[param-herculesCI-primaryRepo]]
=== `primaryRepo`

Information about the repository and revision of the sources that led to the `herculesCI` attribute.

[[param-herculesCI-primaryRepo.outPath]]
=== `primaryRepo.outPath`

A path containing the files of the checked out revision.

[[param-herculesCI-primaryRepo-commit]]
=== `primaryRepo.ref`, `primaryRepo.branch`, `primaryRepo.tag`, `primaryRepo.rev`, `primaryRepo.shortRev`

Same as top-level <<params-herculesCI-commit>>.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-webUrl]]
=== `primaryRepo.webUrl`

Web link to the repository for use in the browser.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-remoteHttpUrl]]
=== `primaryRepo.remoteHttpUrl`

Git remote URL for cloning, etc via the HTTP(S) protocol.

May be `null` for (private) forges that are not configured to offer this protocol.

The HTTP protocol is recommended because it
 - is more often allowed on firewalled networks
 - lets Hercules CI distribute short-lived tokens to Effects; a secure and convenient alternative to personal access tokens or permanent SSH deploy keys.

This will be an `https` URL on most forges, except private forges that don't have TLS enabled.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-remoteSshUrl]]
=== `primaryRepo.remoteSshUrl`

Git remote URL for cloning, etc via the SSH protocol.

May be `null` for (private) forges that are not configured to offer this protocol.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-forgeType]]
=== `primaryRepo.forgeType`

Type of forge the repo is on, e.g. `"github"`.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-owner]]
=== `primaryRepo.owner`

The name of the owner of the repository.

[[params-herculesCI-primaryRepo-name]]
=== `primaryRepo.name`

The name of the repository.

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile/HerculesCIArgs.hs
[[param-herculesCI-herculesCI]]
=== `herculesCI`

Information about the Hercules CI instance the agent is connected to. This is mostly for Hercules CI Enterprise users; who self-manage the entire stack.

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile/HerculesCIArgs.hs
[[param-herculesCI-herculesCI.apiBaseUrl]]
=== `herculesCI.apiBaseUrl`

The base URL of the Hercules CI API. This can be used to differentiate behavior on Hercules CI Enterprise. On non-enterprise agents, the value is `https://hercules-ci.com[https://hercules-ci.com]`. This matches xref:agent-config.adoc#apiBaseUrl[the configuration file].

[[attributes-herculesCI]]
== `herculesCI` Attributes

The `herculesCI` value primarily defines handlers for what to build and run for various events, such as `onPush`.

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile.hs OnPushSchema
[[attributes-herculesCI.onPush]]
=== `onPush`

This declares what to do when a Git `ref` is updated, such as when you push a commit or after you merge a pull request.

If `onPush` is omitted and your `herculesCI` attribute is in a flake, Hercules CI will use the flake to generate <<default-job,a `default` job>>.

If `onPush` is set to `{ }`, no jobs will be created for the push event.

If `onPush` contains attributes, jobs will created for each.

The name will be used as part of the commit status for each resulting job.

// The ability to declare multiple jobs per event is mainly intended to support multiple choices of `extraInputs`.

// hercules-ci-agent/src/Hercules/Agent/NixFile.hs InputDeclSchema
[[attribute-herculesCI.onPush-extraInputs]]
=== `onPush.<name>.extraInputs.<inputName>` (beta)

Specifies a location to an unpinned dependency. The name chosen for the `<inputName>` placeholder will be used as an attribute argument for <<params-herculesCI.onPush-outputs>>.

[[attribute-herculesCI.onPush-extraInputs-project]]
=== `onPush.<name>.extraInputs.<inputName>.project` (beta)

The name of a repository in the same organization.

[[attribute-herculesCI.onPush-extraInputs-ref]]
=== `onPush.<name>.extraInputs.<inputName>.ref` (beta)

A Git ref indicating the branch or tag to check out. Example: `refs/heads/staging` for a branch called `staging`.

[[attribute-herculesCI.onPush-outputs]]
=== `onPush.<name>.outputs`

[[params-herculesCI.onPush-outputs]]
=== `onPush.<name>.outputs` Parameters

The arguments to the `outputs` are sourced from <<attribute-herculesCI.onPush-extraInputs>>, by resolving the inputs to pinned revisions before creating the job.

You can find the pinned revisions in the dashboard or by clicking a commit status.

Other information besides `extraInputs` can be retrieved from the xref:params-herculesCI[`herculesCI` parameters].

[[attributes-herculesCI.onPush-outputs]]
=== `onPush.<name>.outputs` Attributes

These "output" attributes can be

 * derivations,
 * effects IF added in `onPush.<name>.outputs.effects`,
 * attribute sets containing further "outputs", in a nested manner,
 * other types, which will be ignored.

During the execution of the job, first, all derivations will be built. If the build went well, all effects will run, concurrently with effects in the same job, but only after preceding jobs have either completed or failed to build.

==== Derivations, shells and effects

All three are defined through derivations.

 * A derivation marked by the attribute `isEffect = true` is categorized as an xref:effects.adoc[effect] and will be run in the xref:effects.adoc#sandbox[effects sandbox]. Effects must be defined below the `outputs.effects` attribute.

 * A derivation marked by the `buildDependenciesOnly = true` attribute will not be built, but its dependencies will.

 * A derivation with `phases = ["noBuildPhase"]` is treated as if it had `buildDependenciesOnly = true`. This includes Nixpkgs' `mkShell`.

 * A derivation with `ignoreFailure = true` will be built, but not included in the job status and commit status. This is only useful when a build is unpredictable and irrelevant to the development process. `requireFailure` may be a better option, to avoid regressions after repairs.

 * A derivation with `requireFailure = true` will be built and included in the job status and commit status, but with its build status reversed. This is useful during development to track for example which tests are known to fail. If during development a problem is solved, you are required to remove the attribute, which is necessary to avoid regressions.

==== Attribute sets

Unlike the legacy format and `nix-build`, nested attribute sets _are_ traversed by default.

You can mark attribute sets not to be traversed by adding an attribute `recurseForDerivations = false` inside them, as is done by the function `lib.dontRecurseIntoAttrs` of type `attrs -> attrs`.

[[attributes-herculesCI.onPush-outputs.effects]]
=== `onPush.<name>.outputs.effects` Attributes

This is this the only location in `outputs` where effects are allowed.

[[attributes-onSchedule]]
=== `onSchedule` Attributes

_Since hercules-ci-agent 0.9.8_

Behaves similar to <<attributes-herculesCI.onPush>>, but is responsible for jobs
that respond to the passing of time rather than to a `git push` or equivalent.

`onSchedule` is like `cron` for your projects.

[[attributes-herculesCI.onSchedule-outputs]]
=== `onSchedule.<name>.outputs` Attributes

_Since hercules-ci-agent 0.9.8_

Behaves the same as <<attributes-herculesCI.onPush-outputs>>, but for jobs that
respond to the passing of time rather than to a `git push` or equivalent.

[[attributes-herculesCI.onSchedule-when]]
=== `onSchedule.<name>.when` Attributes

_Since hercules-ci-agent 0.9.8_

This attribute set defines at which times a job will be created.
Each subattribute represents an equality, all of which will hold at the next planned time.
The time zone is UTC.

The `minute` or `hour` attributes can be omitted, in which case Hercules CI will pick an arbitrary time for you.

Examples:

```nix
  # an arbitrary time of day, once a each day
  when = { };
```

```nix
  # 1 or 2 in the morning before Central European work days
  when = {
    hour = [ 0 ];
    dayOfWeek = [ "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Thu" "Fri" ];
  }
```

```nix
  # First Tuesday of the month, arbitrary time of day
  when = {
    dayOfWeek = [ "Tue" ];
    dayOfMonth = [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ];
  }
```

 - `minute`: An optional integer representing the minute mark at which a job should be created. Inclusive range: `[0 .. 59]`. Default: an arbitrary minute.

 - `hour`: An optional integer or list of integers representing the hours at which a jobs should be created. Inclusive range: `[0 .. 23]`. Default: a single arbitrary hour.

 - `dayOfWeek`: An optional list of strings representing the days during which jobs should be created. Valid items are `"Mon"`, `"Tue"`, `"Wed"`, `"Thu"`, `"Fri"`, `"Sat"`, `"Sun"`. Default: all days of the week.

 - `dayOfMonth`: A list of integers representing the days of the month during which jobs should be created. Inclusive range: `[1 .. 31]`. Default: all days of the month. Combining with `dayOfWeek` further reduces the number of jobs.

[[default-job]]
== Default `onPush` job

When the `herculesCI.onPush` attribute is omitted, Hercules CI will supply a default definition.

This will build the flake attributes:

  - `packages`
  - `checks`
  - `devShell`
  - `devShells`
  - `apps`
  - `nixosConfigurations`
  - `darwinConfigurations`
  - `effects`

If `effects` is a function, it will receive the <<params-herculesCI, same arguments>> as the `herculesCI` attribute.

=== Ignored attributes

The following attributes are silently ignored, because they do not have a well-defined or independently testable structure.

  - `overlays`
  - `submodules`
  - `nixosModules`
  - `darwinModules`
  - `legacyPackages`

Unknown attributes are also ignored and produce a `trace` line in the evaluation log.

=== Default systems

The `herculesCI` attribute, if it exists, is read for its `ciSystems` attribute; an optional list of "system" strings. If specified, it restricts the job to just the listed architecture-platform combinations.
